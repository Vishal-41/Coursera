          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. 
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, 
          different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
          The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, 
          can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
